I would like you to talk about where you live. Describe your house to me.

## 스크립트
### 도입부
To talk about my house, I live in Seoul with my family **consisting of** 4 members including me. I love where I live. It is a **typical** apartment you can think of.
### 본문
On the inside, There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms. I live on the 4th floor out of 20 floors. I use a card key to unlock the door to mine. Then there's an **entrance area** right next to it. There are shelves on the right **where I can keep my shoes**, leading directly to the living room. The living room is where I usually watch TV, sitting on the sofa and relaxing with a sense of freedom. I guess a living room is very important because you can **do something entertaining** in the living room or you can relax there to recharge yourself. Every room **is connected to** the living room. Each room is used **for different reasons**. One is mainly for sleeping. Another is for clothing. The other is **for multiple purposes**
### 마무리
I believe relaxation is **what my house has to offer**. **From that perspective, I can say** my house is the best place to live.

## 질문 - 집 관련 문제 경험
Things happen from time to time. Tell me about one of the problems you have experienced at home and tell me in detail about what happend.
## 스크립트
### 도입부
**Technically**, it's not very common to see problems at home, but if **water leaks** from upstairs from **time to time**, you can see the **leaky stains** on the ceiling. This can cause another problem that can lead to mold on the wall.
### 본문
I had such an experience about a year ago, and one day, I saw gray spots on the ceiling, and they **got bigger** and bigger. So I called the **maintenace office** so that I could see what was going on. A repairman visited my house to check for the cause. After the inspection, he said it was **due to** a plumbing leak from upstairs.
### 마무리
**The good thing was** it wasn't my falut, so the owner paid for it. **The bad thing is** that it's not fun at all for strangers to visit my home, and I should let them in for a week.

## 질문 - 집 안 변화
Tell me about a change you made to your home. What was the change and why did you make that change? How did your home look afterwards? Give me all the details.
## 스크립트
### 도입부
There might be two reasons why we change things in the house.
### 본문
When people **get used to** something too much, they get kind of **sick and tired of it**. So people start to consider changing things. Or things **wear out or break**. I live in an apartment, so I can't do much on the exterior. That is why **I tend to** Change the interior and furniture from time to time. I bought a sofa 10 years ago. So this year I upgrade it to a **brand new** one. In fact, the leather part of the sofa was **worn out**. It started falling off into pieces, and **since some time ago** I started to need more time to clean them, like a weekly routine, which is so terrible. So I decided to buy a new one online to **replace** the old one.
### 마무리
I think I made a right decision because I'm quite **satisfied with** the purchase that I made.
